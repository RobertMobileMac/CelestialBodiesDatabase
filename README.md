### Celestial Bodies Database

This is for the freeCodeCamp Curriculum Relational Database Course.
It is for the first certification or the third course called the Celetial Bodies Database.

In this course, I am required to create a database in PostgreSQL through gitPod.
The attached file is the culmination of the requirements to complete this course successfully.

**If there was an error during step 2 where it states that the first part of the course needed to be completed
  prior to completing the challenge, then while the gitPod completetion screen is up in the same browser on a different tab,
  refresh the screen of the freeCodeCamp Celestial Bodies course, then paste the link and select complete challenge again.**

_This was how it worked for me._
